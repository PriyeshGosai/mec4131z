# MEC4131Z: Power System Flexible Operation  

This repository contains materials for **MEC4131Z: Power System Flexible Operation**, a course delivered at the **University of Cape Town**. The course explores the increasing need for **flexibility in power systems** to accommodate variability from renewable energy sources and changes in system operation.  

## Course Overview  

The course covers:  
- **Fundamentals of Power System Flexibility**: Understanding different sources of flexibility, including generation, demand response, storage, and transmission.  
- **Operational Challenges and Solutions**: Managing variability and uncertainty in renewable energy integration.  
- **Economic and Policy Considerations**: How electricity markets and regulations impact system flexibility.  
- **Practical Applications with PyPSA**: Using **Python for Power System Analysis (PyPSA)** to model and optimize system operations.  

## Repository Contents  

This repository includes:  
- üìö **Lecture Notes & Readings**: Supporting materials for theoretical concepts.  
- üìù **Jupyter Notebooks**: Hands-on exercises using PyPSA to simulate and analyze power system flexibility.  
- üìÇ **Assignment & Project Templates**: Structured templates for coursework and case studies.  
- üìä **Datasets & Sample Models**: Preconfigured datasets for running simulations.
